				<p> So even though I'm going to be working on this when the time comes I still consider it a finished project. This was a fun one for me because I was able to learn how to code in HTML, Javascript, and CSS after never doing anything like this before besides simple edits! </p>
				<p> This project was started March, 2023 and "Finished" May, 2023 </p>
